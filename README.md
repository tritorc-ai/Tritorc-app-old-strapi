## 🌐 Content

Product catalogues are wired to a live [Strapi](https://strapi.io) CMS instance. Other sections (stats, case studies, certifications, testimonials, etc.) currently use mock data in [`lib/mock`](lib/mock) until their content types are ready — see [`lib/strapi.ts`](lib/strapi.ts) for the swap points.

## ☁️ Deployment

The easiest way to deploy this app is via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new), from the creators of Next.js. See the [Next.js deployment docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for other options.
